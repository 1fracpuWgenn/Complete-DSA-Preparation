Padayappa has received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The film is praised for its engaging storyline, powerful performances, catchy music and stunning visuals. Rajinikanth's portrayal of Padayappa is widely regarded as one of his finest roles, as he showcases his charisma, style and versatility. Ramya Krishnan's performance as Neelambari, the obsessive and vengeful antagonist, is also highly acclaimed, as she matches Rajinikanth's screen presence and delivers some memorable dialogues. Soundarya and Sivaji Ganesan also provide solid support to the lead actors.
 
The film is not without its flaws, however. Some critics have pointed out that the film is too long, has some unnecessary subplots and songs, and relies too much on Rajinikanth's star power. Some have also criticized the film for its portrayal of women, as Neelambari is shown as a negative character who cannot accept rejection, while Padayappa's love interest Vasundhara (Soundarya) is shown as a submissive and obedient woman who follows Padayappa's wishes. Some have also questioned the logic and realism of some scenes and events in the film.
 
Despite these drawbacks, Padayappa remains a classic Tamil film that has entertained millions of viewers over the years. The film has a cult following among Rajinikanth fans and Tamil cinema lovers, who often quote the film's dialogues and rewatch the film on various occasions. The film has also inspired several parodies, references and tributes in other films and media. Padayappa is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys a good masala entertainer with a strong hero, a formidable villain and a lot of drama.
